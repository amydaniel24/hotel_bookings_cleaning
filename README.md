# Hotel Bookings Data Cleaning Project

This project was to get familiar with the datacleaning in Python using the "Hotel Bookings" dataset from Kaggle.

This repository contains my work for learning and practicing data cleaning with pandas. The data used is the “Hotel Bookings” dataset. The goal of this project is simple enough: take a messy dataset, clean it up, and try not to accidentally delete the entire thing in the process.

There are two Jupyter notebooks in this project, so I listed them below so nobody (including me) gets confused later:



1. data_cleaning_walkthrough.ipynb

This notebook follows along with a YouTube tutorial step by step.
If the instructor did it, I did it right behind her like a kid following footprints in wet concrete.

This notebook includes:

Loading the dataset

Inspecting columns and data types

Dropping unnecessary columns

Handling missing values

Cleaning inconsistent entries

Renaming columns

This notebook represents the “learning along with someone else” version.






2. hotel_bookings_cleaning.ipynb

This notebook is the version that I attempted to do independently. It follows the same overall cleaning steps but I just wanted to see if I could clean it without someone holding my hand. 

This notebook includes:

Loading and viewing the dataset

Dropping and renaming columns

Converting data types

Handling missing values 

Using fillna, dropna, and conditional replacements

Additional checks 

This notebook is the “I hope I actually understand what is happening now” version.

# How to Run These Notebooks

Download or clone the repository

Open the folder in VS Code

Install the needed Python packages (mainly pandas and numpy)

Open either notebook and run the cells from top to bottom

Try not to panic when pandas gives you a warning. It does that to everyone. I hope.

# Purpose of This Repository


Practice real-world data cleaning

Follow a structured tutorial

Apply what I learned by rewriting the cleaning process myself

Build confidence working in pandas

Have reference notebooks I can come back to later

Prepare for more advanced analysis and visualizations
